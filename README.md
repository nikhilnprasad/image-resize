# image-resize
Python program to resize a given image.

This is an app written in python that takes in the user's image, and resizes it accordingly. 
The resized image will be saved on the working folder of the user, and will immediately displayed as output.
The parameters of the original image, and the parameters of the new resized image will also be displayed to provide the user with further information for comparison. 

This app uses the package Pillow, a fork of PIL (Python Imaging Library). If this is not installed on your computer, you can do so by opening the terminal, and typing the following command:

pip install pillow

And that's it!
